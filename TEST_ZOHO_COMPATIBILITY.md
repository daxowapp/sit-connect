2. Fetches field metadata
3. Compares with expected fields
4. Shows detailed report

### Report Shows:
```
Module: Accounts
✅ Total Fields: 45
✅ Matched: 40
⚠️  Missing: 5

Missing Fields:
- Featured_University (optional)
- Custom_Field_1 (optional)

Impact: Minimal - core features work
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Class not found"
**Solution:** Check namespace and use statement in App.php

### Error: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** You need 'manage_options' capability (admin user)

### Error: "Zoho API error"
**Solution:** Check Zoho API credentials in Settings → Zoho API

### Page is blank
**Solution:** Check PHP error log for syntax errors
