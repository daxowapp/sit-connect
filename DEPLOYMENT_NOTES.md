# SIT Search Plugin - Deployment Notes

## Version: Production Ready
**Date:** October 13, 2025

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Top Universities Shortcode Fix
**File:** `src/Shortcodes/TopUniversities.php`

**Issue:** Only showing 2 featured universities instead of all 4.

**Root Cause:** CSS was hiding carousel cloned items needed for proper carousel functionality.

**Solution:**
- Removed debug/error_log statements
- Cleaned up query logic
- Ensured proper country filtering is applied
- Query now correctly fetches universities that are:
  - Featured (`Featured_Univesity` = 1 or true)
  - Active (`Active_in_Search` = 1 or true)
  - In active countries (if country filter is enabled)

### 2. CSS Carousel Fix
**File:** `assets/css/sit-search.css`

**Issue:** Cloned carousel items were hidden, breaking the Owl Carousel loop functionality.

**Solution:**
- Commented out the CSS rule that was hiding `.owl-item.cloned` elements
- Carousel now properly displays all 4 featured universities
- Shows 3 items at a time on desktop with smooth navigation

### 3. Template Cleanup
**File:** `templates/shortcodes/top-universities.html.php`

**Changes:**
- Removed all debug HTML comments
- Clean, production-ready template

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clear all caches:**

   - CDN cache (if applicable)

2. **Verify on production:**
   - Check that all 4 featured Spanish universities display
   - Test carousel navigation
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Verify country filtering works

## Known Limitations

- Country filtering applies (only shows universities from active countries)
- Carousel requires at least 2 universities to initialize

## Support Notes

If featured universities are not showing:
1. Verify the university has `Featured_Univesity` = 1
2. Verify the university has `Active_in_Search` = 1
3. Check if country filtering is enabled in ACF Options
4. Verify the university's country is in the active countries list
5. Clear all caches
