# Zoho CRM Compatibility Guide

## 🎯 Problem: Different Zoho Configurations

Different clients may have different Zoho CRM configurations:
- Different custom fields
- Different field names
- Missing fields
- Additional fields

**Solution:** SIT Connect handles this gracefully!

---

## ✅ Built-in Protection

### 1. **Safe Field Access**
The plugin uses safe field access throughout:

```php
// ❌ OLD (causes errors if field missing)
$value = $data['Featured_University'];

// ✅ NEW (safe, returns empty if missing)
$value = $data['Featured_University'] ?? '';
```

### 2. **Field Validator Service**
New `ZohoFieldValidator` class:
- Detects available fields in client's Zoho
- Logs missing fields
- Provides compatibility report
- Suggests field mappings

### 3. **Compatibility Checker Page**
**Location:** SIT Connect → Zoho Compatibility

**Features:**
- Check which fields are available
- See missing fields
- View field mapping suggestions
- Get compatibility report

## 🔍 What Happens with Missing Fields?

### Example: Client Missing "Featured_University" Field

**Without Protection (OLD):**
```
❌ PHP Error: Undefined array key "Featured_University"
❌ Sync fails
❌ Site breaks
```

**With Protection (NEW):**
```
✅ Field not found → uses empty value
✅ Sync continues
✅ Site works normally
✅ Missing field logged for admin
```

### Example: Client Has Different Field Name

**Scenario:** Client has "Is_Featured" instead of "Featured_University"

**Solution:**
1. Compatibility checker detects similarity
2. Suggests mapping: `Featured_University` → `Is_Featured`
3. Admin can configure mapping
4. Sync uses correct field

---

## 🛠️ Field Mapping Configuration

### Automatic Detection
The plugin automatically tries to match fields:

```
Expected: Featured_University
Available in Zoho: Is_Featured, Featured, University_Featured

Auto-suggestion: Featured_University → Is_Featured (70% match)
```

### Manual Mapping (Future Feature)
Admin can manually map fields:

```
SIT Connect Field    →    Zoho CRM Field
Featured_University  →    Is_Featured
QS_Rank             →    University_Ranking
```

---

## 📊 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Zoho Setup
```
✅ All fields match
✅ No configuration needed
✅ Works out of the box
```

### Scenario 2: Custom Field Names
```
⚠ Field names different
✅ Auto-detection finds matches
✅ Works with suggestions
```

### Scenario 3: Missing Optional Fields
```
⚠ Some fields missing
✅ Plugin uses defaults
✅ Core functionality works
⚠ Some features disabled
```

### Scenario 4: Missing Required Fields
```
❌ Critical fields missing
⚠ Sync may be incomplete
→ Add fields to Zoho
→ Or contact support
```

---

## 🔧 Required vs Optional Fields

### Required Fields (Must Have)

**Universities (Accounts):**
- `Account_Name` - University name
- `id` - Zoho record ID

**Programs (Products):**
- `Product_Name` - Program name
- `id` - Zoho record ID
- `University` - Linked university

### Optional Fields (Nice to Have)

**Universities:**
- `Description`
- `QS_Rank`
- `Number_Of_Students`
- `Year_Founded`
- `Featured_University` ← Example
- `uni_image`
- `uni_logo`

**Programs:**
- `Official_Tuition`
- `Study_Years`
- `Degrees`
- `Program_Languages`
- etc.

**Impact if Missing:** Features work but may show empty values

## 📝 Client Onboarding Template

### Email Template

```
Subject: SIT Connect - Zoho Configuration Check

Hi [Client Name],

I'm setting up SIT Connect for your site. To ensure everything works
perfectly with your Zoho CRM, I need to check field compatibility.

Could you please provide:
1. Zoho API credentials (Client ID, Secret, Refresh Token)
2. Access to a test/staging Zoho environment (if available)

I'll run a compatibility check and let you know if any adjustments
are needed.

This is a one-time setup to ensure smooth operation.

Thanks!
```

### After Compatibility Check

```
Subject: SIT Connect - Compatibility Report

Hi [Client Name],

Good news! I've completed the Zoho compatibility check:

✅ Compatible Fields: [X] out of [Y]
⚠️ Missing Fields: [List]

Impact:
- [Explain what works]
- [Explain any limitations]

Options:
1. Proceed as-is (recommended if impact is minimal)
2. Add missing fields to Zoho
3. Custom field mapping (additional cost)

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Attached: Full compatibility report
```

## 🔒 Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

**Philosophy:** Plugin should never break, even with missing fields

**Implementation:**
```php
// Every field access is safe
$value = $data['field_name'] ?? 'default_value';

// Taxonomy access is safe
$terms = get_the_terms($id, 'taxonomy');
$value = ($terms && !is_wp_error($terms) && !empty($terms)) 
    ? $terms[0]->name 
    : '';

// Array access is safe
$lookup = $data['University']['name'] ?? '';
```

### Error Logging

**What Gets Logged:**
- Missing fields during sync
- API errors
- Data validation failures

**Where:**
- WordPress debug.log
- SIT Connect → Zoho Compatibility page
- Admin notifications

---

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always use safe field access**
   ```php
   $value = $data['field'] ?? '';
   ```

2. **Check field existence before critical operations**
   ```php
   if (isset($data['required_field'])) {
       // Process
   }
   ```

3. **Provide fallback values**
   ```php
   $image = $data['uni_image'] ?? 'placeholder.jpg';
   ```

4. **Log missing fields**
   ```php
   if (!isset($data['field'])) {
       error_log('Missing field: ' . $field);
   }
   ```

### For Clients

1. **Run compatibility check after installation**
2. **Review missing fields report**
3. **Decide on optional fields**
4. **Test sync with sample data**
5. **Monitor for errors**
