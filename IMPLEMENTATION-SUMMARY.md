# SIT Connect - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What Has Been Completed

Your plugin has been successfully upgraded with all the features needed for commercial sale!

---

## 1. ✅ Color Customization System

### What It Does
Allows buyers to customize the plugin colors to match their brand without touching any code.

### Features Implemented
- **Admin Settings Page** with intuitive color pickers
- **4 Customizable Colors:**
  - Primary Color (main brand color)
  - Primary Dark Color (gradients, hover states)
  - Secondary Color (accent elements)
  - Accent Color (highlights, special elements)
- **Live Preview** - see changes before saving
- **Reset to Default** - one-click restore
- **Automatic Application** - colors inject via CSS variables

### Files Created
- `/src/Actions/RegisterSettingsPage.php` - Settings page with color pickers
- `/src/Actions/InjectCustomColors.php` - Injects custom colors into frontend

### How Users Access It
WordPress Admin → **SIT Connect** → **Color Customization** tab

---

## 2. ✅ Plugin Rebranding

### Changes Made
- **Old Name:** Study In Türkiye Search
- **New Name:** SIT Connect
- **Version:** 2.0.0 (from 1.0)
- **Text Domain:** `sit-connect` (from `study-in-turkiye-search`)
- **Description:** Professional, commercial-ready description

### Files Created/Modified
- **NEW:** `/sit-connect.php` - Clean, properly encoded main plugin file
- **OLD:** `/sit-search.php` - Original file (should be removed/renamed)

### Action Required
You need to deactivate the old plugin and activate the new one:
```bash
# Rename old file
mv sit-search.php sit-search.php.old

# Then activate "SIT Connect" in WordPress admin
```

---

## 3. ✅ License Management System

### What It Does
Protects your plugin by requiring buyers to activate with a valid license key.

### Features Implemented
- **License Activation** - Users enter key + email
- **Domain Binding** - License tied to specific domain
- **Remote Verification** - Checks with your server every 7 days
- **Admin Notices** - Reminds users to activate
- **Deactivation** - Users can deactivate to move sites
- **Graceful Handling** - Shows notices but doesn't break site

### Files Created
- `/src/Services/LicenseChecker.php` - License validation logic
- `/license-server-example.php` - Sample server implementation

### How It Works
1. User purchases from you → receives license key
2. User installs plugin → sees activation notice
3. User goes to **SIT Connect** → **License** tab
4. Enters license key + email → activates
5. Plugin checks with your server → validates
6. Every 7 days, re-verifies automatically

### What You Need to Do
Set up a license server (3 options provided):
1. **Freemius** (easiest) - handles everything
2. **Build your own** - use provided example code
3. **WooCommerce + License Manager** - if you have WooCommerce

Then update these files with your server URL:
- `/src/Actions/RegisterSettingsPage.php` (line ~331)
- `/src/Services/LicenseChecker.php` (line ~13)
